PROJECT TITLE: Simple calculator using python
Project Description: This project implements a simple calculator in Python that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator is designed to be user-friendly and interactive, allowing users to select the desired operation and input numbers for calculations.

TECH  STACK:
Programming Language:-
Python: The primary language used for developing the calculator due to its simplicity and readability.
Development Environment:Text Editor/IDE: Any code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as:
Visual Studio Code
PyCharm
Jupyter Notebook (for interactive testing)
Version Control:
Git: For tracking changes and managing versions of the project code.
Execution Environment:Command Line/Terminal: To run the Python script and interact with the calculator.

FEATURES OF THE SIMPLE CALCULATOR:
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports fundamental calculations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
User -Friendly Interface: Provides a simple console-based interface that allows users to easily select operations and input numbers.
Error Handling: Implements robust error handling to manage invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values and division by zero, ensuring a smooth user experience.
Interactive Input: Prompts users for input dynamically, allowing them to perform multiple calculations in a single session.
Arithmetic Operations: The calculator supports four fundamental operations:
Addition: Combines two numbers.
Subtraction: Computes the difference between two numbers.
Multiplication: Calculates the product of two numbers.
Division: Divides one number by another, with error handling for division by zero.
User Input: The program prompts the user to select an operation and enter two numeric values for the calculation.
Error Handling: The calculator includes mechanisms to handle invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values and attempts to divide by zero, ensuring a smooth user experience.
Output: The result of the selected operation is displayed clearly, showing the calculation performed.

HOW TO RUN:
Step 1: Install Python
If you haven't already installed Python on your computer, you can download it from the official website:

Download Python: python.org
Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

Step 2: Create a Python File
Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like:

Visual Studio Code
PyCharm
Jupyter Notebook
IDLE (comes with Python installation)

Step 3: Run the Python File
You can run the Python file in several ways:
Using Command Line (Terminal)
Open your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).

Navigate to the directory where you saved your calculator.py file. You can use the cd command to change directories. For example:
cd path\to\your\directory

Step 4: Interact with the Program
Once the program is running, it will prompt you to select an operation (1-4) and enter two numbers. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform calculations.
Example Interaction
Select operation.
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
